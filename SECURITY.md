When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following details:

- A clear and descriptive summary of the vulnerability.
- Steps on how to reproduce the issue.
- The version of the application you were using.
- Any screenshots or code snippets that could be helpful.

### What to Expect

After you have submitted a report, you can expect the following:

1.  A confirmation of receipt within **48 hours**.
2.  An initial assessment of the vulnerability's severity and impact within **5-7 business days**.
3.  Regular updates on our progress as we work to validate and patch the vulnerability.

We will do our best to keep you informed throughout the process and will publicly credit you for your discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous) once the vulnerability has been resolved.
